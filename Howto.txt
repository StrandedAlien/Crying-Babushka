Colburns plugin sports its own cloth physics. VERY easy to use.
Just play around, youÂ´ll figure it out. Questions are welcome.
It generates a shapekey for each animation. 

Howto:
- Install above plugin. It runs perfectly under 2.93 and is a lot easier
 to use than the updated version he also offers. Consider support.
- Choose your collision oject first.
- View 3D- N Panel-Extended Tools-Push set collider button
- Choose cloth object
- View 3D- N Panel-Extended Tools-Push Modeling cloth button
- Play with the update buttons and Grab and Reset.

  the third key "modeling cloth key" and play with the value slider underneath
